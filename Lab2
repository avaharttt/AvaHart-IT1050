// a. Our application ends at the last bracket on line 23.
// b. Integer variables must show an integer value, or a whole number. Floating point variables are a real number with a decimal point which can come before or after the numbers.
// c. An example of a method can be shown in lines 10, 13, 18, and 22 when the Console.WriteLine action was used.
// d. Get accessor and set accessor.
// e. A class is a collection of similar objects and has no memory allocated for it. An object has its own memory and cannot exist without a class. Classes do not have values associated with the fields, but every object does. There is no limit on how many objects in a clas can be created, though computer memory will limit it.
